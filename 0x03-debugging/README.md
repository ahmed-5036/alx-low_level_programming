# Debugging Practice: Fixing and Testing Code

This repository contains solutions to debugging exercises. The tasks involve identifying and fixing issues in given code snippets. Each task focuses on specific debugging concepts and techniques.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Multiple mains

In this task, you will create a new `0-main.c` file to test the `positive_or_negative()` function with the value `0`. This task emphasizes testing the given function with different inputs.

### Task 1: Like, comment, subscribe

In this task, you are required to comment out the code that is causing an infinite loop in the provided `1-main.c` file. This task helps you understand how to effectively comment out code to prevent unintended behavior.

### Task 2: 0 > 972?

You will fix the logic of the `largest_number()` function, which currently does not correctly determine the largest of three integers. This task highlights debugging issues related to conditional statements and comparisons.

### Task 3: Leap year

This task involves fixing and testing the `print_remaining_days()` function, which calculates the remaining days in a year while considering leap years. The current implementation has issues with leap year calculations. This task focuses on debugging logical errors and complex conditions.

## Getting Started

To test and fix the code for each task, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the respective task directory.
2. Open the provided source files (e.g., `0-main.c`, `2-largest_number.c`, etc.).
3. Apply the necessary fixes to the code based on the task description.
4. Compile the code using the appropriate compiler flags (e.g., `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`) and the required header files.
5. Run the compiled executable to verify that the issues have been resolved.

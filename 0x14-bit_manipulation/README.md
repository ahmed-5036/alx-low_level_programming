# Binary Manipulation

This repository contains C programs that perform various binary manipulation tasks. Each program is designed to adhere to specific requirements and constraints outlined in the project description.

## Task Descriptions

1. **Task 0: Binary to Unsigned Int**
   - Function: `binary_to_uint`
   - Converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

2. **Task 1: Print Binary Representation**
   - Function: `print_binary`
   - Prints the binary representation of an unsigned long int.

3. **Task 2: Get Bit at Index**
   - Function: `get_bit`
   - Returns the value of a bit at a given index in an unsigned long int.

4. **Task 3: Set Bit at Index**
   - Function: `set_bit`
   - Sets the value of a bit at a given index to 1 in an unsigned long int.

5. **Task 4: Clear Bit at Index**
   - Function: `clear_bit`
   - Clears (sets to 0) the value of a bit at a given index in an unsigned long int.

6. **Task 5: Count Flipped Bits**
   - Function: `flip_bits`
   - Calculates the number of bits that need to be flipped to convert one unsigned long int to another.

7. **Task 6: Endianness**
   - Function: `get_endianness`
   - Checks whether the system is using big-endian or little-endian byte order.

## Requirements

- Code is written in C.
- Compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with specified options.
- Adheres to the Betty style for code formatting.
- No global variables are used.
- Maximum of 5 functions per file.
- Use of standard library functions is limited to `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`.
- `_putchar` is allowed.
- Header file `main.h` contains function prototypes and is include-guarded.
- README.md provides an overview of the project and tasks.

# ALX Low-Level Programming - Nested Loops

This repository contains solutions to a series of C programming exercises related to nested loops, as part of the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum.

## Task 0: _putchar

The `_putchar` function is a simple implementation of the `putchar` function, which prints a character to the standard output. The program demonstrates the usage of `_putchar` to print the string "_putchar" followed by a newline.

## Task 1: print_alphabet

The `print_alphabet` function prints the lowercase English alphabet in a single line, followed by a newline. It demonstrates the use of nested loops to iterate through the alphabet characters and `_putchar` function to print each character.

## Task 2: print_alphabet_x10

The `print_alphabet_x10` function prints the lowercase English alphabet ten times, each time on a new line. It utilizes nested loops to achieve the desired output and showcases how to repeat a process multiple times.

## Task 3: _islower

The `_islower` function checks if a given character is lowercase. It returns 1 if the character is lowercase and 0 otherwise. This task showcases the use of conditional statements and ASCII character codes.

## Task 4: _isalpha

The `_isalpha` function checks if a given character is an alphabetic character (either lowercase or uppercase). It returns 1 if the character is alphabetic and 0 otherwise. This task demonstrates the usage of conditional statements and ASCII character ranges.

## Task 5: print_sign

The `print_sign` function prints the sign of an integer: + for positive, - for negative, and 0 for zero. It returns 1 for positive, -1 for negative, and 0 for zero. This task illustrates the use of conditional statements to determine the sign of a number.

## Task 6: _abs

The `_abs` function computes the absolute value of an integer. It returns the absolute value of the input number. This task showcases the use of conditional statements and arithmetic operations to calculate absolute values.

## Task 7: print_last_digit

The `print_last_digit` function prints the last digit of an integer and returns its value. It demonstrates the use of modulo arithmetic to extract the last digit and the `_putchar` function to print it.

## Task 8: jack_bauer

The `jack_bauer` function prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer in the format "HH:MM," covering the range from 00:00 to 23:59. This task involves nested loops to iterate through hours and minutes and demonstrates time formatting.

## Task 9: times_table

The `times_table` function prints the multiplication table for the numbers from 0 to 9 in a well-formatted grid. This task showcases the use of nested loops to calculate and display multiplication results.

## Task 10: add

The `add` function calculates the sum of two integers and returns the result. This task demonstrates basic arithmetic operations and function implementation.

## Task 11: print_to_98

The `print_to_98` function prints all natural numbers from a given number to 98, separated by commas and spaces. It handles both increasing and decreasing sequences. This task illustrates the use of loops and conditional statements to achieve the desired output.

Each task demonstrates different concepts of nested loops, conditional statements, arithmetic operations, and function implementation in C programming.

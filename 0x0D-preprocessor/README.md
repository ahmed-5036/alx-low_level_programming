## Task Descriptions

1. **Task 0: Object-like Macro**
   - Create a header file defining a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.

2. **Task 1: Pi**
   - Create a header file defining a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.

3. **Task 2: File Name**
   - Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from.

4. **Task 3: Function-like Macro**
   - Write a function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.

5. **Task 4: SUM**
   - Write a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C development environment.
- A text editor for viewing and editing C code.
- A terminal or command prompt for compilation and execution.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Object-like Macro

The objective of this task is to define an object-like macro named `SIZE` in the `0-object_like_macro.h` header file.

### Task 1: Pi

In this task, you'll define a macro named `PI` in the `1-pi.h` header file.

### Task 2: File Name

Write a C program in `2-main.c` that prints the name of the file it was compiled from.

### Task 3: Function-like Macro

Create a function-like macro `ABS(x)` in the `3-function_like_macro.h` header file that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.

### Task 4: SUM

Write a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` in the `4-sum.h` header file that computes the sum of two numbers `x` and `y`.

### 0-preprocessor

This script runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file. The C file name is stored in the variable `$CFILE`. The output is saved in the file `c`.

### 1-compiler

This script compiles a C file but does not link it. The C file name is stored in the variable `$CFILE`. The output file is named the same as the C file but with the extension `.o`.

### 2-assembler

This script generates the assembly code of a C code and saves it in an output file. The C file name is stored in the variable `$CFILE`. The output file is named the same as the C file but with the extension `.s`.

### 3-name

This script compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`. The C file name is stored in the variable `$CFILE`.

### 4-puts

This C program uses the `puts` function to print the text "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle" followed by a new line.

### 5-printf

This C program uses the `printf` function to print the text "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art" followed by a new line.

### 6-size

This C program prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

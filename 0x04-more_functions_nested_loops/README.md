# 0x04 - More Functions, More Nested Loops

This repository contains C programs that implement various functions using functions and nested loops. The goal of these tasks is to practice using control structures, loops, and basic functions.

## Task 0: isupper

Write a function that checks if a character is uppercase.

**Prototype:** `int _isupper(int c);`

* Returns 1 if `c` is an uppercase character.
* Returns 0 otherwise.

## Task 1: isdigit

Write a function that checks if a character is a digit (0 through 9).

**Prototype:** `int _isdigit(int c);`

* Returns 1 if `c` is a digit.
* Returns 0 otherwise.

## Task 2: mul

Write a function that multiplies two integers.

**Prototype:** `int mul(int a, int b);`

* Returns the product of `a` and `b`.

## Task 3: print_numbers

Write a function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

**Prototype:** `void print_numbers(void);`

## Task 4: print_most_numbers

Write a function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9 (excluding 2 and 4), followed by a new line.

**Prototype:** `void print_most_numbers(void);`

## Task 5: more_numbers

Write a function that prints the numbers from 0 to 14 (inclusive) ten times, followed by a new line after each sequence.

**Prototype:** `void more_numbers(void);`

## Task 6: print_line

Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

**Prototype:** `void print_line(int n);`

* Prints `n` number of `_` characters, followed by a new line.
* If `n` is 0 or less, only a new line is printed.

## Task 7: print_diagonal

Write a function that draws a diagonal line in the terminal.

**Prototype:** `void print_diagonal(int n);`

* Prints `n` number of `\` characters, each preceded by spaces for diagonal effect.
* Followed by a new line.
* If `n` is 0 or less, only a new line is printed.

## Task 8: print_square

Write a function that prints a square in the terminal.

**Prototype:** `void print_square(int size);`

* Prints a square of side length `size` using `#` characters.
* Followed by a new line.
* If `size` is 0 or less, only a new line is printed.

## Task 9: Fizz-Buzz

Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz".

## Task 10: print_triangle

Write a function that prints a right-angled triangle in the terminal.

**Prototype:** `void print_triangle(int size);`

* Prints a right-angled triangle of height `size` using `#` characters.
* Followed by a new line.
* If `size` is 0 or less, only a new line is printed.
